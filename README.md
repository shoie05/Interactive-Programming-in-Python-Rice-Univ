Mini projects and assignments completed during the course on Interactive programming in python offered by Rice University through Coursera.

It is 5 weeks  and  7-10 hours/week course .
The final grade was based on a weighted combination of one-third of the quiz scores and two-thirds of the mini-project scores (each scaled to 100).
